# Quite Opening

I started as white, <1. d4 Nf6 2. e3 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Be2 d6 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 c6 7. Nc3 Nbd7 8. Qa4 e5> . Black didn't challenge the center early, I had a comfortable opening, and want to expand on the queen side, <9. b4> this is inaccurate because black can challenge the b4 pawn <main2 main 9... exd4 10. Nxd4 a5> .

# Misplaced Knight

Instead black closes the center and kicks my knight <9... e4> . I remember from my previous analysis <10. Nh4> this is a blunder because c4 is weak black can play <main3 main 10... Nb6 11. Qa5 Be6> . Instead <10... Re8 11. g3 Nb6 12. Qc2 Bh3 13. Rd1 d5> black gains a tempo on my queen, develops it's bishop and strengthens the e4 pawn, white is just reacting passively.

# Misevaluating brings more mistakes

Black is attacking the c4 pawn, I defend it and want to exchange knights <14. Na4> but black can still <main4 main 14... Nxc4> white can't recapture because <main5 main4 15. Bxc4 dxc4 16. Qxc4 b5> . Instead black retreats, both develop <14... Nbd7 15. Bd2 Rc8> . I think my position is fine and want to expand on the queen side, black maneuvers it's knight <16. Nb2 Qe7 17. a4 Nf8 18. Qb3 Ne6 19. a5 Ng5 20. a6 b6> . I achieve a6, now I want to open files and target a7 pawn (which is far from happening).

Black is slightly improving it's position even though it doesn't look like it. Rooks are exchanged <21. Rc1 Qe6 22. cxd5 cxd5 23. Rxc8 Rxc8 24. Rc1 Rxc1 25. Bxc1 Bf8 26. Bd2 Bg4> , black wants to exchange my good bishop, go Qh3 and mate me on h2. I want to avoid that <27. Bf1> black shuts down it's attack <27... Nf3+> though it's still slightly better for black. <28. Nxf3 exf3 29. Qc2> I take the open file but the best move is to bring the knight in <main6 main 29. Nd3> . Black insists on bishop exchange <29... Bh3> I make my final blunder <30. Bd3 Bg2> and suddenly Qh3 is coming and there is no Nd3, Nf4 to stop it, I might try <31. Qc7> but my position is losing and I lose on time.
